These short, punchy emails are designed to spark curiosity and get demo requests.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
EMAIL TEMPLATE 1: The Cost Shock
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Subject: Your site surveys cost $1,500. Ours take 10 minutes.

Hi [Name],

Quick question: How much are you spending on site surveyors right now?

Most solar companies pay $1,500-$3,000 per survey and wait 5-10 days for results.

We built an AI that does the same analysis in 10 minutes. From photos.

- Shading analysis with AI vision
- Electrical panel assessment (no electrician needed)
- Roof risk evaluation
- NEC 2023+ compliance check
- Professional PDF report

I've attached a sample report and 1-page overview.

Worth a 15-minute demo?

EMAIL TEMPLATE 2: The Pain Point
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Subject: Tired of waiting 10 days for site survey results?

[Name],

Your site surveyor just told you "5-10 business days."

Your client is waiting. Your competitor already sent their proposal.

What if you could send a complete site analysis in 10 minutes instead?

Our AI platform analyzes roof photos and delivers:
→ Shading analysis (30 seconds)
→ Electrical assessment (20 seconds)
→ Roof condition report (40 seconds)
→ Code compliance verification (instant)
→ Professional PDF (1 click)

No site visit. No electrician. No waiting.

Sample report attached. See it in action?

Best,

EMAIL TEMPLATE 3: The Competitor Edge
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Subject: How solar companies are closing deals 10x faster

Hi [Name],

While your competitors wait days for site surveys, some companies are sending proposals the same day.

They're using AI.

Our platform replaces:
✗ $1,500 site surveyor → AI photo analysis
✗ $500 electrician visit → AI panel assessment
✗ Manual shading calculations → AI vision + math
✗ 5-10 day timeline → 10 minutes

The analysis quality? Better than manual. (See attached sample report)

EMAIL TEMPLATE 4: The ROI Teaser
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Subject: $14,000/month → $0 (site survey costs)

[Name],

If you're doing 10 solar projects per month:

Current cost: $14,000 in site surveys
With our AI: Essentially $0

That's not a typo.

Upload photos → AI analyzes everything → Download report.
No surveyors. No electricians. No waiting.

I've attached a real report our AI generated.

Can I show you how this works live?

EMAIL TEMPLATE 5: The Curiosity Hook
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Subject: We replaced your site surveyor with AI

Hi [Name],

Bold claim, I know.

But we actually did it:

→ Upload 3 photos (roof, electrical panel, surroundings)
→ AI analyzes shading, electrical capacity, roof condition
→ Get professional report in 10 minutes

No jokes. No exaggeration.

The sample report is attached. Look at the detail.

Now imagine getting that for every project. Same day. Zero cost.

EMAIL TEMPLATE 7: The Problem-Solution
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Subject: The site survey bottleneck is over

Hi [Name],

Three problems every solar company faces:

1. Site surveys are expensive ($1,500+)
2. They're slow (5-10 days minimum)
3. Shading analysis has 15-30% error margin

We solved all three with AI:

1. Photo upload (free, instant)
2. Analysis in 10 minutes (AI-powered)
3. 100% accurate (AI vision + solar math)

Check the attached sample report. This is what AI can do.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE TIPS:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Keep subject lines under 50 characters - make them scannable
2. First sentence should shock or intrigue them
3. Use numbers ($1,500, 10 minutes) - they're concrete and memorable
4. Always mention the sample report attachment
5. End with a soft ask, not a hard pitch ("Worth a demo?" vs "Schedule now")
6. Include the live demo URL so they can explore themselves
7. Send from a real email (not noreply@) so they can respond easily

BEST PRACTICES:
- Send Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11 AM (highest open rates)
- Personalize [Name] with their actual first name
- If no response in 3 days, send a short follow-up: "Hey [Name], did you get a chance to check out that sample report? Happy to answer any questions."
- Track which template gets the best response rate and use that as your primary
